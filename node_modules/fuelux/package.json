It is actively maintained by [members of Salesforce Marketing Cloud,](https://github.com/orgs/ExactTarget/people) with the support and involvement of the community.\n\nMore thorough documentation and guides available at <http://getfuelux.com>\n\n# Documentation\n\nFuel UX documentation is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://getfuelux.com>. More details on setting up Jekyll and running docs locally can be found [in our CONTRIBUTING.md documentation](https://github.com/exacttarget/fuelux/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-gh-pages-locally).\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.\n\n# Obtaining Fuel UX\n\nNPM is the recommended method for obtaining Fuel UX.\n```\nnpm install fuelux\n```\n\nYou can also use on of the following methods:\n- [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) `bower install fuelux` (update with `bower update fuelux`).\n- [Volo](https://github.com/volojs/volo) `volo add fuelux` (update with `volo add -f fuelux`).\n- Clone via git `git clone https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/`\n  - Cloning the repository ensures you can apply future updates to Fuel UX easily, but requires to you manage its [dependencies](#dependencies) on your own.\n- Download a [.zip archive](http://www.fuelcdn.com/fuelux/3.16.0/fuelux.zip).\n\n# Using Fuel UX\n\nFuel UX can be used with an existing page via CDN or installed in a project.\n\nRead the [Getting started page](http://getfuelux.com/getting-started.html) for more detailed information on the framework contents, templates, examples, and more.\n\n## Required fuelux class\n\nAdd `fuelux` class to the portion of the page using Fuel UX, usually the body.\n```\n<body class=\"fuelux\">\n```\n\n## Required Dependencies\nFuel UX is dependent upon [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) and [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). If you installed by cloning the repo or by downloading a .zip archive, you'll also want to grab these dependencies, as it won't work without them.\n- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)\n- [Bootstrap 3](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)\n\nFor other methods of managing dependencies consider [AMD support via require](#amd-support).\n\nEnsure all the dependencies are included on the page (eg, such as using the CDN as shown below).\n```\n<link href=\"//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n<link href=\"//www.fuelcdn.com/fuelux/3.16.0/css/fuelux.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.1/js/bootstrap.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"//www.fuelcdn.com/fuelux/3.16.0/js/fuelux.min.js\"></script>\n\n```\n\n\n## What's included\nThe code you want is in `dist/`. We provide compiled CSS and JS (like `fuelux.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (like `fuelux.min.*`) in the `dist` folder. Icons are provided as fonts.\n```\nfuelux/\n├── css/\n│   ├── fuelux.css\n│   ├── fuelux.min.css\n├── js/\n│   ├── fuelux.js\n│   └── fuelux.min.js\n└── fonts/\n    ├── fuelux.eot\n    ├── fuelux.svg\n    ├── fuelux.ttf\n    └── fuelux.woff\n```\n\n\n## AMD support\n\nWe recommend only loading the controls you need (eg `fuelux/checkbox`).\n\nIf using AMD (such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org)), reference the FuelUX directory in your paths configuration, wherever it is located:\n```javascript\nrequire.config({\n    paths: {\n        'fuelux': 'http://www.fuelcdn.com/fuelux/3.16.0/'\n        //...\n    }\n});\n```\nThen list any individual fuel ux controls needed as dependencies within your application modules:\n```javascript\ndefine(function(require) {\n    var spinbox = require('fuelux/spinbox');\n    //...\n});\n```\nIn instances where you require every module from Fuel UX, you can use `fuelux/all` instead of listing each module individually.\n\nFuel UX also supports placing components in their own `<script>` tags. Be sure to [check component dependencies in the controls documentation](http://getfuelux.com/javascript.html) and put modules in the correct order if you load them in this method. Errors will appear in the console if you have not loaded dependencies correctly ((Repeater)[http://getfuelux.com/javascript.html#repeater-dependencies] and [Scheduler](http://getfuelux.com/javascript.html#scheduler-dependencies) are the only components with dependencies currently).\n\n\n# Bugs and Feature Requests\n\nHave a bug or a feature request? Please first review the [open issues](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/issues), then search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/issues/new).\n\nFor additional assistance connect with the [community](#community).\n\n\n# Previous releases\n\n[Documentation for v2.6](http://getfuelux.com/2.6/) has been made available for the time being while folks transition to Bootstrap 3. You can download 2.6 updates (bug fixes only) from the [fuelux2 branch](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/tree/fuelux2).\n\n# Community\n\n- Implementation help may be found at Stack Overflow (tagged [`fuelux`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fuelux)).\n- Follow [@FuelUX on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fuelux).\n\n# Philosophy\nOur aim is to provide a suite of related but independent projects that help web developers integrate, manage, and customize quality libraries and utilities to more efficiently develop, maintain, test, and distribute their projects.  Any improvements or fixes we make to the open source projects, we use will be contributed upstream if they are useful to the rest of the community.\n\nThank you to all those that have submitted issues and contributed to this library.\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2012-2014 Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Inc.\n\nView [BSD-3 license](https://github.com/ExactTarget/fuelux/blob/master/LICENSE).\n",
